				<h2>2011-2019 : First Steps, Tennis Arc 🎾</h2>
				<p>I started tennis at 7, encouraged by my father. It was clearly my favorite sport during my whole childhood, but I stopped at the begnning of my secondary school. I wanted to change cause it was frustrating as I couldn't do as many tournaments as I wanted. Actually my parents couldn't bring me every week to other cities to play, which is understandable.</p>

				<h2>2019-2021 : English Boxing Arc 🥊</h2>
				<p>I started boxing with the "Noble Art" with friends during my first year of secondary school. I really appreciated it but I next discovered a more complete kind of boxing...</p>

			<div>
				<h2>2020-2022 : Musculation Arc 🏋🏼</h2>
				<p>In addition to boxing, I started musculation (as you can see on my Youtube channel or my Instagram), It was a good thing to increase my power and to become more explosive, but I had to stop when I started my prépa, cause I wanted to focus on my studies.</p>

			<div>
				<h2>Since 2021 : Final Step, Kick Boxing Arc 💪🏼</h2>
				<p>Here we are, the best sport of my life. What makes me switch from English to Kick Boxing is initially a friend that convinced me to try. From then on, I never stopped kick. </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Since the begninning of HEC : Rugby Arc 🏉</h2>
				<p>It's only with HEC that I discovered team sports. As I had many friends that played rugby during my childhood, it was logical for me to try now I had the opportunity to start from 0 with many other students. Today I don't regret, it's such an incredible sport and I have discovered my best friends there.</p>
